### Example 7

**🧭 Scenario:** Baseball Game - Day Out at Wrigley Field

**🗣 Partner said:** Wow, these seats are great! Look at this view! And itâs such a beautiful day! The baseball season is from April through September which is spring and summer throughout the United States, so the weather is almost always warm. Have you ever been to a baseball game before?

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** I was there one time in Chicago.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** Saying 'I've been to a game' sounds more natural and fluent than 'I was there one time.'

**🎯 Ideal Tip:** Good try! 'I've been to' is used for life experiences, while 'I was there' describes a specific moment. Using 'I've been to' sounds smoother and more natural in casual conversation.

### Example 8

**🧭 Scenario:** Baseball Game - Day Out at Wrigley Field

**🗣 Partner said:** Got it. So can you tell me what you already know about the rules of baseball?

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** You do a strike and there's something called home run.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** Use 'You get a strike' instead of 'You do a strike' â itâs the natural way to describe baseball rules.

**🎯 Ideal Tip:** Nice effort! In English, we say 'get a strike' because 'get' describes what happens to the player. 'Do a strike' sounds like you are the one making the strike

### Example 11

**🧭 Scenario:** Campus Encounter - Small Talks

**🗣 Partner said:** Maddie: âNow itâs your turn to respond â âwhatâs good with youâ is another way to ask âhow are youâ. Why donât you tell Eddie what youâve been up to the last few weeks?â

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** Same old, same old, going to class, finish the task and sleep.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** Adding 'up' after 'finishing' makes it sound more natural. Great start with 'same old, same old' â thatâs a common phrase!

**🎯 Ideal Tip:** Excellent tone! 'Same old, same old' is exactly what native speakers say. Using '-ing' forms like 'finishing up' makes your rhythm smoother and matches how people talk about ongoing routines.

**🧪 Eval Tip:** A

**📈 Tip Score:** 0.80

**✏️ Model Rewrite:** Same old, same old. Just going to class, finishing up tasks, and getting some sleep.

### Example 12

**🧭 Scenario:** Campus Encounter - Small Talks

**🗣 Partner said:** Maddie: âSo weâre about to walk by Mika. Youâre friendly with her, but you donât know her that well. It might be awkward if we stop to talk, so in this case just give them a wave and one of those casual greetings like âHi there,â âwhatâs up?â, or âwhatâs going on?â. You can quickly compliment part of her outfit if you want too.â Mika: âHi there! Oh my god, I love your shoes!â *keeps walking*

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** Me too. I love your appearance. It look beauty.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** 'Appearance' can sound personal; 'outfit' is more casual for clothes. Also, use 'looks' instead of 'look' for correct grammar.

**🎯 Ideal Tip:** Nice compliment! In English, 'outfit' sounds friendly and casual, while 'appearance' can feel too personal. 'You look great!' is a warm, natural way to compliment someone you donÕt know very well.

**🧪 Eval Tip:** A

Weâre going to their party this weekend. First, you should say hi with one of your new greetings and then you can tell them how excited you are for the party!â

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** I'm excited for the Saturday, our party.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** Use 'on Saturday' instead of 'for the Saturday' to sound more natural when mentioning a specific day.

**🎯 Ideal Tip:** Great enthusiasm! We say 'on Saturday' instead of 'for Saturday' when talking about a specific day. Your sentence sounds friendly and natural once you switch the preposition.

**💬 Model Tip:** That sounds good! You could add a bit more detail about your plans or activities to make it feel more conversational.

### Example 4

**🧭 Scenario:** Happy Hour - First Networking Event

**🗣 Partner said:** I'm from Iowa! I grew up in the capital, Des Moines, but it's pretty small for a capital so it feels like a small town. How's it been settling in here? You doing anything fun this weekend?

**👩‍🎓 Learner said:** I think we are just gonna live at home and maybe invite invited some friends over.\n

**💬 Model Tip:** Use 'going to' instead of 'gonna' for a more natural sound, and 'stay home' is more common than 'live at home' in this context.
